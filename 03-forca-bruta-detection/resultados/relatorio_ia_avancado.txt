 1. Executivo Summary: The report detected 5.00% of the analyzed events as anomalous, indicative of potential brute force attacks. The top 10 IPs with the most suspicious activities are listed below, with a high risk level assigned to them (Alto).

2. Type of Attack: Based on the number of attempts, these can be classified as rapid attacks.

3. Risk Level:
   - IP: 192.168.1.62, 192.168.1.32, 192.168.1.39, 192.168.1.10, and 192.168.1.17 - High (Alto) risk
   - IP: 192.168.1.17, 192.168.1.86, 192.168.1.7, 192.168.1.28, 192.168.1.67, and 192.168.1.37 - Medium (Médio) risk

4. Indicators of Compromise (IoCs): Not explicitly listed in the report. However, IoCs could be extracted from the IP addresses, locations, and number of attempts for each event.

5. Possible attack vectors and motivations: It is likely that these attacks are originating from automated bots or scripts attempting to gain unauthorized access to resources. Motivations may include password guessing, account takeover, or system exploitation.

6. Immediate actions recommended:
   - Block the critical IPs immediately
   - Implement rate limiting (max 5 attempts/minute)
   - Notify users about access attempt
   - Investigate slow and pattern attacks
   - Continuously monitor with this model

7. Firewall rules suggested: iptables, ufw, or fail2ban can be used to implement these recommendations effectively.

8. Hardening system authentication recommendations:
   - Use strong password policies
   - Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible
   - Limit login attempts from a single IP address
   - Regularly audit and update user accounts and permissions

9. Continuous monitoring and alerts suggestions: Set up notifications for unusual login activities, failed login attempts, and other security events to keep track of potential threats.

10. Additional recommendations: Consider implementing intrusion detection systems (IDS) or security information and event management (SIEM) solutions for comprehensive network protection and alerting capabilities.
